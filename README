== Expenses

In order to track expenses and mileages for the purpose of easily filing
taxes.  It lets you record expenses throughout the year as you go or all at
once (if you start late or are just procrastinating).

=== Expenses

You enter date, vendor, amount, and a category.  There are a number of
categories in the test/fixtures/categories.yml file that you can load with:

    rake db:fixtures:load FIXTURES=categories

You are free to edit the fixture to put the categories in an order that makes
the data entry more convenient for you or change the names.  These names make
sense as-is for those (like me) who use TurboTax because they match.

=== Mileages

It's useful to put an entry with the same starting and ending odometer reading
on the first day of the year.

The "split" is useful when the IRS changes the standard mileage rate mid-year.
